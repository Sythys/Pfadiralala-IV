\beginverse*
{\nolyrics Intro: \[Am] \[C] \[G] \[Am] \rep{2}}
\endverse

\beginverse
The \[Am]pictures tell the story, this \[C]life has many shades
I'd \[G]wake up every morning and be\[Am]fore I'd start each day
I'd take a \[Am]drag from last night's cigarette, that \[C]smoldered in its tray
\[G]Down a little something and \[Dm]then be on my way\[Am]
\endverse

\beginverse
I \[Am]traveled far and wide and \[C]laid this head in many ports
I was \[G]guided by a compass, I saw \[Am]beauty to the north
I drew the \[Am]tales of many lives and wore the \[C]faces of my own
I had these \[G]memories all around me so I \[Dm]wouldn't be alone
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[C]Some may be from showing up, \[G]others are from growing up
\[Dm]Sometimes I was so messed up and \[Am]didn't have a clue
I ain't \[C]winning no one over, I \[G]wear it just for you
I got your \[Dm]name written here in a rose tattoo

In a \[Am]rose tattoo, in a \[C]rose tattoo
I got your \[Dm]name written here in a \[G]rose tattoo
\endchorus

\beginverse*
{\nolyrics Interlude: \[Am] \[C] \[G] \[Am]}
\endverse

\beginverse
\[Am]This one's for the mighty sea, \[C]mischief, gold and piracy
\[G]This one's for the man that raised me, \[Am]taught me sacrifice and bravery
\[Am]This one's for our favorite game, \[C]black and gold, we wave the flag
\[C]This one's for my family name, with \[Dm]pride I'll wear it to the grave
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[C]Some may be from showing up, \[G]others are from growing up
\[Dm]Sometimes I was so messed up and \[Am]didn't have a clue
I ain't \[C]winning no one over, I \[G]wear it just for you
I got your \[Dm]name written here in a rose tattoo

In a \[Am]rose tattoo, in a \[C]rose tattoo
I got your \[Dm]name written here in a \[G]rose tattoo
\endchorus

\beginverse*
Bridge:
\[F]This one means the most to me, it \[C]stays here for eternity
A \[G]ship that always stays the course, an \[Am]anchor for my every choice
A \[F]rose that shines down from above, I \[C]signed and sealed these words in blood
I \[G]heard them once, sung in a song, it \[G]played again and we sang along
\endverse

\beginverse
You’ll \[Am]always be here with me, \[C]even if you’re gone
You’ll \[G]always have my love, our \[Dm]memory will live on
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[C]Some may be from showing up, \[G]others are from growing up
\[Dm]Sometimes I was so messed up and \[Am]didn't have a clue
I ain't \[C]winning no one over, I \[G]wear it just for you
I got your \[Dm]name written here in a \[N.C.]rose tattoo

In a \[Am]rose tattoo, in a \[C]rose tattoo
I got your \[G]name written here in a \[Am]rose tattoo
In a \[Am]rose tattoo, in a \[C]rose tattoo
With \[G]pride I’ll wear it to the \[Am]grave for you

In a \[C]rose tattoo, in a \[G]rose tattoo
I got your \[Dm]name written here in a \[Am]rose tattoo
In a \[C]rose tattoo, in a \[G]rose tattoo
Signed and \[Dm]sealed in blood, I would \[Am]die for you
\endchorus
